        <h2 style="text-align: center;">DEVELOPD A FINANCE MANAGMENT APP(JUNE 2019-DEC 2021)</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            Developed a full-stack personal finance management application using Java, serving over 2,000 active users with an
            intuitive interface for tracking income, expenses, and budgeting goals, resulting in a 20% increase in user engagement
            through improved usability and performance.
            Utilized Jira for Agile project management, managing 12 sprints with an average 95% completion rate of user stories,
            tracking progress, and fostering collaboration within a cross-functional team of 8 developers and 2 designers.
            Designed and developed a responsive, user-friendly front-end interface using Angular, Bootstrap, HTML5, and CSS3,
            ensuring cross-browser compatibility and optimal performance across 15+ device types, reducing page load times by 50%.
            Integrated multi-factor authentication (MFA) using Spring Security, improving user account security and reducing
            unauthorized access attempts by 85% and ensuring secure access to sensitive financial data.
            Implemented advanced data visualization of financial trends using Angular, UI Material, and Chart.js, enhancing user
            decision-making with 25+ customizable charts and real-time data updates, which contributed to a 30% increase in
            feature adoption.</p>
<P style="text-align: center;"> Managed backend data storage using MySQL, optimizing database queries with JPA and Spring Data. This resulted in
            50% faster data retrieval and an overall 20% improvement in application performance.
            Built dynamic tax filing assistance and reporting features, enabling users to export financial summaries and reports in
            PDF/CSV formats, leveraging Spring MVC and JSP for generating reports. This feature reduced manual report
            generation time by 40% for users, improving user satisfaction.
             Implemented unit testing with JUnit, achieving 90%+ test coverage, and reducing the frequency of production bugs by
            60%. Ensured robust backend services and API reliability, contributing to the app’s stability.
            Automated CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, streamlining deployment processes and achieving 95% fewer deployment
            failures. This ensured error-free production releases across environments and reduced deployment time by 30%.
            Deployed the application to Microsoft Azure, utilizing Azure App Services for scalable hosting and secure data storage,
            resulting in 99.9% uptime and ensuring high availability during peak usage times.
            Analyzed and processed financial transaction data in Jupyter Notebooks, identifying spending patterns and budget
            trends. This insight was integrated into the application’s reporting features, improving budget accuracy by 20% and
            enhancing financial decision-making for users.
