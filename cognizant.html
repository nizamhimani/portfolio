        <h2 style="text-align: center;">DEVELOPD AN ERP SYSTEM(JAN 2022-DEC 2022)</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Engineered and deployed a robust ERP system using Java, automating critical business processes including inventory management, sales, procurement, finance, HR, and CRM, improving operational efficiency by 40% and reducing manual intervention by 50%.

Architected and optimized backend microservices using Spring Boot and Spring Security, implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, enhancing system security and performance, and supporting 10,000+ concurrent users without degradation in response time.

Designed and fine-tuned relational databases with PostgreSQL, implementing advanced indexing, normalization, and query optimization techniques, reducing query execution time by 35% and improving data consistency.

Developed dynamic, responsive front-end interfaces with React leveraging hooks and Redux for state management, resulting in a 30% improvement in user interaction speed and a 25% decrease in page load times across ERP modules.

Implemented aspect-oriented programming with Spring AOP to modularize cross-cutting concerns like logging, transaction management, and security, improving code maintainability by 40% and enabling a 15% reduction in
development time for new features.</p>
<p>Enhanced test coverage and ensured backend reliability using Mockito for unit testing, achieving 90% test coverage for
service layer components, leading to a 20% reduction in production defects and increasing system stability.
 Containerized the entire ERP application using Docker and orchestrated deployment via Kubernetes, reducing deployment
time by 70% and enabling seamless scaling, resulting in a 40% reduction in infrastructure costs during peak usage.
 Utilized AWS services for cloud hosting, architecting a highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and cost-efficient solution that
dynamically scaled with traffic, resulting in a 99.99% uptime and a 30% reduction in operational costs.
â€¢Deployed and optimized the ERP system on Apache Tomcat, fine-tuning performance through connection pooling,
session management, and resource allocation, resulting in a 20% improvement in response time and a 15% decrease in
server resource utilization.</p>
